# UFO Analysis
## *Overview*
Dana wants comprehensive, readable data available for UFO sightings across the United States. Her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon, is famous for UFO sightings and has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. She plans to incorporate data she obtained in a javascript file with more than 100 various sightings into her research of McMinnville. She will be breaking down the javascript objects into a table on a webpage that is easily viewed and filtered.

## *Results*
This webpage is pretty user friendly; it's set up to take user input and display the correponding data. You can enter as many or as few filters as you want in order to see what all comes up on a particular date, in a particular city/state/country, or in a particular shape (with regards to the sighting itself). See Figure A below.

## *Summary*
The country filter is a little bit misleading since all of the entries are in the United States. The data is also limited; while there are about 110 sightings, they all appear to have taken place in January of 2010. For future updates to the site, Dana might want to consider 1) removing the country filter and 2) obtaining additional sightings from other years *OR* setting expectations that you can filter the date specifically to any date in January of 2010. Either way, a small summary of the scope of the data up front would be helpful to the user.
